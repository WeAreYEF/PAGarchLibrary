I am a frequent reader,at [PAGarchlib](https://github.com/WeAreYEF/PAGarchLibrary),the space has alot of innovative books but at the moment I prefer concentrating on one ,which is **introduction to telecommunications and electronics**,reason being I am participating in an **open hardware maker** and I have a modular radio project of which they are mentoring me on.So my favorite book for now is ![](images/telecommunications.jpg).It helping research and note basics of modulation,here is the link to my project>>>[Modulor radio project](https://github.com/chardso/building-an-fm-radio-transmitter)

I would like to extend my great thanks to **r0g** (Agency for open culture and critical transformation) on behalf of **YEF**(The Youth Empowerment Foundation) for lobbying funds for this kind of innitiative, it's an initiative which will benefit generation after generation,applauds to **Mr Steven kovarts** and the friends who supported the idea and all those who are yet to add in the support.Not forgetting my great community Access to skills and knowledge network **(#ASKnet)** which is the supporting partner,which entrusted The Youth Empowerment Foundation **(YEF)** to implement this wonderful innitiative."long live the three giant partners,**r0g**,**ASKnet** and **YEF**".

She is a student leader at pagirinya secondary school,so excited having the opportunity to access [PAGarchlib](https://github.com/WeAreYEF/PAGarchLibrary) where she got courage to dismiss the believe that architecture is only for boy's that what boys can do, girls can also do, "However Maridio also lamented that the resource is going to accelerate access to knowledge for the young people of her age instead of staying iddle".She also tasked herself as a student leader to sensitize other students especially her fellow girls to join her at the space to utilize the resource,other than staying iddle.She applauded The Youth Empowerment Foundation **(YEF)** for such a great opportunity and urged them give them a chance to peer to peer basic computer skills on weekends for them to be able to apply the knowledge acquired in a digital way since the world of today is all about computer.much ðŸ’• **YEF**.

He is a design artist,the occupation he resumed after his senior four due to lack of funding to further his studies,but since he was good in fine art ,he resorted to applying the skills obtained from school in fine art lessons,He is greatful for the opportunity brought by The Youth Empowerment Foundation **(YEF)**,as the resource is well equiped with the books ðŸ“š of his field of interest."I am also requesting for peer to peer computer training lessons to go hand in hand with the utilization of the library resources,big up's **YEF**.
